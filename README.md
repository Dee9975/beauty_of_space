# Beauty Of Space

An app that displays some cool photos from NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day programme.

## Getting Started

To use the app you must first create a `.env` file in the root of the project that contains a `KEY` field

```
KEY=[YOUR_KEY_HERE]
```

[Get your own api key](https://api.nasa.gov/).

When you have the key, in your terminal run: `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

Then all that's left is to run `flutter run` and enjoy some beautiful space photography
